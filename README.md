# **IPL Exploratary Data Analysis**

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on IPL (Indian Premier League) data to gain insights and inform decision-making in the cricket tournament. The following steps were undertaken to analyze the data and derive valuable insights:

## **Data Collection and Preparation:**

•	IPL data was obtained from reliable sources such as Kaggle or the official IPL website.

•	Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to handle missing values, data type conversions, and standardization.


## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
•	Python was used to conduct EDA on the IPL dataset, leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

•	Visualizations, and data aggregation techniques were employed to explore the data and identify trends and patterns

## **Key Insights:**
•	Based on the analysis, the following key insights were derived:

•	Most successful IPL teams based on win percentages and total championships.

•	Impact of batting or bowling first on match outcomes.

•	Player performance analysis, including highest run-scorers and wicket-takers.

•	Players with most man of the match awards.

•	Relationship between team performance and home ground advantage.


## **Technologies Used:**

•	Python: Used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

•	Jupyter Notebook: Used as the development environment for Python scripting and analysis.

•	Data Visualization Libraries: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations.
